      <p>
        SnapSage was born out of a real-world challenge encountered during a
        7-month online software development boot camp. Our founder, an avid
        learner, frequently captured screenshots of critical code snippets and
        examples from live lectures. However, the struggle to organize these
        images, named with generic and uninformative labels, became a
        substantial roadblock in the learning process. Finding the right
        screenshot at the right time was a hassle, and the idea for SnapSage
        took root - an innovative solution to an increasingly common problem.
